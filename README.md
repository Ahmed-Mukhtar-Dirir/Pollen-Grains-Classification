# Pollen-Grains-Classification

#### The problem that the proposed system is solving is to classify pollen grain images into one of four classes:
1.	Corylus avellana, well-developed pollen grains (Class 0).
1.	Corylus avellana, anomalous pollen grains (Class 1).
1.	Alnus, well-developed pollen grains (Class 2).
1.	Debris (bubbles, dust and any non-pollen detected object) (Class 3).

#### Please read the report for more explanation.
